How to quantify this in a better way?  

If we pick 365 points at random they will not do as well as corresponding to our map as the
real galaxies.  But what we want is to ask if we use our map to find galaxies
in the region, how well do we get the observed galaxies?  

Perhaps we should focus on telescope fields.  How many random fields to observe to get
half of the galaxies vs how many fields to observe following the obsplan?
 
The area of the HZOA survey is -5 < b < 5 and -148 < l < 36.
* Create a healpix map of number of galaxies using GalMap.py from HZOA survey
* Which healpix regions lie within the survey?
* Order these regions randomly.
* Calculate cumulative number of galaxies with number of fields 
* What is the median number of fields?
* Can we estimate this statistically if each of 365 galaxies is it own field?
* How many random fields to get half of the galaxies?
