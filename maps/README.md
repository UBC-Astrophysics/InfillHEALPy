These maps were created from the 2-MASS Photo-Z survey using galaxies with 0.01 < z < 0.2 and smoothed to one degree using GalMap.py from ObsPlan.  One hundred bootstrap resamplings were also generated.

The infilled map was created using Infill.py for the actual map and the resamplings.  The sigmamap.fits is the dispersion over the resamplings.

You can use PlotMap.py to view any of these maps.
